Email API
Description:

This Email API is a web service designed to facilitate the seamless delivery of emails based on incoming requests from the Cart API. Developed to scale with other applications within our app, the Email API sends the receipts to our clients. 

The API listens over the address https://cna-email-service.azurewebsites.net/



How It Works:

    Authentication and Authorization: The Email API employs robust authentication mechanisms, including JWT (JSON Web Tokens), to ensure secure access to its endpoints. Incoming requests are validated to verify the authenticity of the source, preventing unauthorized access.

    Request Handling: Upon receiving a request, the Email API parses the incoming data to extract essential information such as the user ID, email content, and recipient address. This data is then used to compose the email message.

    Integration with User Data: To personalize the email content and ensure accurate delivery, the Email API interacts with a separate Users API. It queries the Users API with the provided user ID to retrieve the associated email address. This seamless integration ensures that emails are sent to the correct recipients.

    Email Composition and Delivery: With the necessary recipient information obtained, the Email API constructs the email message, including the subject, body, and any relevant attachments or links. Utilizing industry-standard email delivery services such as SendGrid, the API ensures reliable and timely delivery of emails.

    Response Handling: Upon successful delivery of the email, the Email API generates a response indicating the status of the operation. This response includes details such as the delivery status, any errors encountered during the process, and confirmation of successful delivery.

    Error Handling and Logging: In the event of errors or exceptions during the email sending process, the Email API provides comprehensive error handling and logging functionalities. Detailed error messages and logs enable efficient troubleshooting and resolution of issues, ensuring smooth operation.

Benefits:

    Scalability: The Email API is designed to handle a high volume of email requests efficiently, making it suitable for applications of any scale.
    Security: With built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms, the Email API ensures that only authorized users and applications can access its functionalities, safeguarding sensitive data.
    Reliability: Leveraging industry-leading email delivery services, the Email API guarantees reliable and timely delivery of emails, minimizing the risk of communication failures. Namely, it utilizes SendGrid's SMTP / Email relay API to send the messages and handle the communication. This minimizes in-house hosting needs.
    Customization: The Email API offers flexibility in composing email messages, allowing customization of content based on user preferences, application context, and business requirements.

Use Cases:

    E-commerce Platforms: Send order confirmations, shipping notifications, and promotional offers to customers.
    SaaS Applications: Notify users about account activities, subscription renewals, and product updates.
    Enterprise Systems: Facilitate internal communication by sending alerts, reminders, and reports to employees and stakeholders.
